Cmake config explanation:
cmake ..
Tells CMake to configure the SDL project located in the parent directory (..), assuming you're in a build/ directory.

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
Builds SDL with optimizations enabled and without debug symbols.

-DSDL_TEST=OFF
Skips building SDL's internal test suite (not needed for installation or development use).

-DSDL_STATIC=OFF
Disables building of the static SDL3 library (.a files), and only builds the shared/dynamic version (.so).

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
Installs the SDL3 library and headers to /usr/local, which is the standard location for user-installed (non-package-managed) software.

This setup avoids cluttering the system-managed /usr directory and allows easy removal later if needed.
